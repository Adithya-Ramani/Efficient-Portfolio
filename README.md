# Efficient Frontier in Portfolio Analysis

The Efficient Frontier was a cornerstone principle in the Modern Portfolio Theory. A rational investor is very concerned about the preservation of capital and the returns he generates of his portfolio, essentially focusing on the risk reward tradeoff. He would want to minimize his risk for an assumed level of expected return or would want to maximize his returns for a given level of risk. This is where the ‘Efficient Frontier’ comes into use.

 A portfolio is a construction of various asset types, equity, debt, real estate, gold, etc. After the portfolio is constructed, it has its characteristics, its expected return (return) and variance (risk). These factors differ in value when compared to the individual securities that go into a portfolio. This portfolio is represented as a ‘Dot’ on the graph, which has the ‘X-label’ representing the various levels of risk, the ‘Y-label’ representing the various levels of return. This graph is the Efficient Frontier. Various portfolios are marked on this graph, representing various levels of risk and return. 
 
The goal of the Efficient Frontier is to populate the optimum portfolio out of the set of portfolios available. An optimum portfolio is that portfolio that offers the highest level of return for a given level of risk. So how does The Efficient Frontier help us identify the ‘Optimal Portfolio’. As we saw, the X-label represents risk, so a portfolio at the right end has greater risk, and a portfolio to the left has less risk. 

Thus, a risk-averse individual would opt for a portfolio at the left of the graph. As, y-axis represents the returns, a portfolio that is further up has greater returns than the one below it. Thus, the Efficient Frontier plots all the portfolios and helps us measure their risk-return profile.

As a measure to reduce risk, diversification of portfolio is employed. Assets with negative co-variance can help reduce the portfolio risk. This diversification is represented by the curvature of the Efficient Portfolio. By diversification, we pool assets that are less that positively correlated so that the movement in 1 asset has less or no correlation to the movement of the other asset. Diversification must reduce portfolio risk without sacrificing portfolio returns.
